DoubleVim

It's hard work to move our hands to grab the mouse and click on something. 
It takes forever.
Let's click with our keyboards now.

*Run with following command*
`python grid.py`

Or *Run with executable*
`VVim.exe`

*How to use*
1. Open grid using `ctrl + windows + v` (This will open the grid on key release)
2. Press the combinations you want to click on.

*When the grid is up.*
    - Use `arrow keys` to adjust the grid.
    - Press `esc` to close the grid.
    - Press `ctrl + windows + q` to quit the program.


*Problems*
1. Opening the grid takes the focus. This might be a problem when other programs react to loosing focus.
2. Unable to bring the grid over system-level windows. Such as `Windows-Start`
